## How can I try the permaweb for free?

Expect this answer to update. There are several methods, depending on what you want to test out.

### As an enduser:
You could try uploading files < 100kb in size using ArDrive and it will be paid for on your behalf. [https://ardrive.io/start](https://ardrive.io/start/)

### Programmatically you have 2 options depending on the usage:

1. For testing L1 txs (base level txs, e.g. value transfer txs), you can use ArLocal. [ArLocal](https://github.com/textury/arlocal)
2. You can upload real, live L2 txs using Bundlr's node2 endpoint, for data < 100kb. [Hello World (CLI)](./quick-starts/hw-cli.md)
